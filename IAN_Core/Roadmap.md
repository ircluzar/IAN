# Project Prod: Roadmap to Autonomous Wisdom at Scale

---

## Vision

**Goal:**  
Deploy the IAM system as a production-ready, fully autonomous machine that, when started with zero memory, recursively builds itself toward wisdom using LLMs. The system must be able to self-organize, adapt, and explain its progress, with every agent type contributing meaningfully and all major decisions and achievements logged and auditable.

---

**Project Prod** now supports distributed execution, agent checkpointing, health monitoring, cloud orchestration, web dashboard, code scaffolding, hot-reload, knowledge distillation, provenance tracking, agent teams, negotiation, lifelong learning, curriculum generation, memory pruning, agent documentation, and open source readiness, as well as all previously completed features.

**Project Prod will deliver a truly autonomous, explainable, and wisdom-seeking LLM agentic machine—ready for real-world deployment, continuous evolution, and community-driven innovation.**
